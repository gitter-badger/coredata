# CoreData
CoreData is a web software that you can use to create websites and enrich them with different modules. Each website can consist of one or many modules. It has web-api it's extendable. And it's really fast thanks to ASP.NET Core. 

**Getting started**  
You can develop and run it in Linux, Mac or PC. To get started, install Visual Studio Code if you like command line approach or Visual Studio 2015 (Windows Only) if you are IDE kind of guy. Then get Core SDK https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windows

**More**  
For good starting material (and let's be honest, where lot of core external components come from) is available on @joeaudette in project related to cloudscribe. This MVP has gone ahead and done a multi-tennant core asp.net mvc groundwork and it's great reference source for basic starting point.

**Near future**  
In the near future, after moving everything accessable to web-api, there is a plan to create alternative Angular.js web ui that would access the wep-api features and could theoretically package with Cordova for mobile phones and tablets enabling native applications with the same backend.
